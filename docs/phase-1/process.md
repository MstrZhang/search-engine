# PROCESS

## Overview
We tried our best to optimize the communication between all of our team members. This was done through optimizing our use of git (through intelligent branching) and through weekly meetings. The group as a whole would meet together once or twice a week and also communicate intermittently through Discord to give each other updates

---

## Organization
Tasks were divided amongst members based on individual strength. During our weekly team meetings we would peer review each other's work, contribute ideas, and give suggestions for improvement

During the week, we would update one another on the work we were doing over Discord. As well as that, we also used separate channels in Discord to break up discussion topics (such as organizing discussions for various questions, files, and outstandings tasks)

### Tools Used

- Discord
- Git
- Bitbucket

## Decision Making
We started weekly meetings distributing tasks amongst the team members. During the week, each team member would work on their own tasks independently. At weekly meetings, each team member would showcase the work they had done so far and the rest of the team would provide input and suggestions if there were any

## Priority
Priority is discussed heavily in the `user_stories.md` file. To reiterate:

    Priority is determined through two cases:

    1. The feature is a crucial feature:
        - The two crucial features are as follows:
            1. Users must be able to create an account
            2. Users must be able to search the system regardless of whether they are registered or not
    2. Another feature is dependent on the completion of the given feature

Again, difficulty of user stories was discussed in the `user_stories.md` file

## Next Steps

1. Continue to emphasize communication
    - Give constructive feedback if necessary
2. Adhere to the branaching structure
    - Continue to use good practices and update the README file
3. Improve task allocation
