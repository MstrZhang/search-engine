# Competition

## Competing Technologies
There are two existing products that are similar to our product: 

- Blackboard
    - Platform that allows teachers to create and manage course pages while also allowing students of these courses access to the course page
    - Teachers can upload documents, assignments and supplmentary materials while students can access these materials as dictated by the teachers
- Piazza
    - Discussion board that allows teachers and students to communicate with each other and answer questions regarding the course and course material

## Our Selling Point

- Things BlackBoard lacks:

    - A search engine
        - Only allows users from UTSC to have access to courses currently being taught or taken (depending on user)
        - There is no easy way to query for specific information
            - Our product will have a structured query format allowing for more specific searches
        - Can't access previous course material
            - Our product will be able to access all resources added to the system

- Things Piazza lacks:

    - Cannot search contents of other courses
        - Limited to only the contents of the courses you're enrolled in
            - Our product will allow all users to search for any kind of academic information from UTSC while being efficient and easy to use

## Why Competitors Don't Provide Our Benefits

BlackBoard and Piazza both suffer from the same reasons for why they cannot easily provide the benefits of our platform

- Difficulty of implementation
    - It is not easy to implement a full search engine
        - Requires indexer, user interface, query language
- Cost
    - Time required to implement
    - Monetary cost of implementation
