# OBJECTIVES

Create a usable, well designed search engine for UTSC students to search, upload, and query past assignments, projects, and other academic information. The application will allow registered users to connect to other users in the system and follow their updates and the resources they've shared. Non-registered users will be able to search the system given a set of query parameters they provide

# KEY PRINCIPLES

1. The user experience comes first
    * The design of the application should always be built with the idea of the user in mind
        * The user should never feel encumbered to use the system
2. Top performance under all conditions
    * Performance should be the same regardless of the hardware used to access the system
        * Performance should be equally good on an old or new device
    * Performance should remain equally good regardless of execution
        * A query returning a large result should operate as fast as a query returning a small result
3. User experience should be the same across all users
    * Every user type should find the system equally easy to use
        * Despite user differences, overall experience should remain equally good
