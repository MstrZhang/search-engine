Our team did not finish all the task assigned for this sprint.
All primary functionality were completely implemented and code has been refactored.
The majority of the optional features(profile page, following users, commenting) were completed this sprint. All that remains are UI adjustments to allow a more user friendly environment to work in.
The team mainly had issues with availability due to overwhelming amount of final projects being due at this time of the semester.
