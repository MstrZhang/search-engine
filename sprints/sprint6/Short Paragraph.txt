Our team did not finish all the task assigned for this sprint.
All primary functionality were completely implemented and code have been refactored.
Majority of the optional features(profile page, following users, commenting) were completed this sprint. All that remains are UI adjustments to allow a more user friendly environment to work in.
Again, the mainly mainly had issues with availability due to overwhelming amount of final projects being assigned before the semester ends.
