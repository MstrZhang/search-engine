Our team did not finished all of the tasks in the sprint.
All functionality is completed, however most unit tests are not completed yet.
This is because we prioritised working features above testing as they are necessary to complete the next set of user stories.
Our team mainly had issues of availiability and free time to work on the project as this week and the last had multiple midterm exams and tests in other courses.
