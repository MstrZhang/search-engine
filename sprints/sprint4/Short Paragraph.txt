Our team did not finish all tasks in the sprint.
Most of the functionality was implemented in this sprint aside from changing the storage 
system to database and updating indexing from the database.
Optional features were considered during this sprint to be put up as tasks.
The team suffered from having little time to work on the project as midterms were still
happening and assignments from other courses.
