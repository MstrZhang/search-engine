Competition

	There are two existing products that are similar to our product. Blackboard and Piazza(maybe). Blackboard lacks a search engine and only allows users from UTSC to have access to it. Our product will allow all users to search for any kind of academic information in the system while being efficient and easy to use. This is better for all of its users. 
	Students will have the ability to explore their interest in other courses or get ahead in their studies as they will have access to all academic information. This will also allow for students to review taken courses to solidify their knowledge. Professors will be able to easily keep track on lectures from other professors, teaching the same course, by searching up their name or course code. Users outside of UTSC will be able to view academic posts. 
	Blackboard most likely didn't give global access to academic information to all users to keep the academic information private to the professor and students taking a course. A student could get confused with which notes to read if they had to search for it. Professors could get lost with what they have and have not posted.

	The university probably wants to keep academic information privatized to the univeristy
