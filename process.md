Process

- Make sure to have a picture of your team together having lunch/dinner or coffee.  Each member in
the team must be visible in the picture and must be together.[do we need?]

- How did we work together?
- Organization?

Used discord to communicate and share relevent files.
Made decisions as a group. Passed around ideas and debated whether it was good or not.

- How did you define priority and/or difficulty of user stories? (User stories not done yet[as of when this doc was edited])

Meet in person and online.
We meet weekly (once a week).

- What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
